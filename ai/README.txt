How i used ChatGBT
While coding according to the spec and looking through online examples, i asked ChatGBT if i was correctly using certain tools for model evaluation (testing) and if it was fine according to modern day testing standards. In terms of mocking, I was asking if it was fine to override methods rather use direct implementation due to the fact that we will get tested against incorrect implementation, hence i used reflection as part of testing.


Question
I plan to use reflection for an assignment and i would like to know if i am correctly using it. I have followed from this website https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html. Here is my code, I just need your advice and not to improve the quality of the code as it is an assignment. Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)
    public void testFireBulletWithNoShip() throws Exception {
        Field shipField = GameModel.class.getDeclaredField("ship");
        shipField.setAccessible(true);
        shipField.set(model, null);
        model.fireBullet();
    }



Answer
Thought for 10 seconds
getDeclaredField("ship") returns the private field; good.

shipField.setAccessible(true) is the right way to bypass Java access checks inside a test.

shipField.set(model, null) is correct because ship is an instance field; you pass the model object, not null for a static.

JUnit-4 style:

java
Copy
Edit
@Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)
(Make sure the annotation, not a comment, is on the method.)

Confirm that each test gets a fresh GameModel; otherwise other tests might still see ship == null.

Optionally restore accessibility ( shipField.setAccessible(false) ) or reset the field after the assertion, but JUnit usually recreates the fixture so it isn’t required.

Accessing private fields via reflection in unit tests is acceptable when the spec demands a particular internal state and no public API exposes it.

For mocks: prefer a mocking framework (e.g., Mockito) or small test-only subclasses; avoid changing the production code just for tests unless the design truly needs it.

Question
You said:
Ok cool. But it is fine to manually access private fields in testing to ensure correct implmentation even if it will be tested with incorrect implmentation to assert that the test reflect the specification right?

Answer
Yes, allowed—but with caveats.

Reflection-based access is acceptable when the assessment explicitly targets internal state that is not exposed through the public API.

Make sure the assignment rubric / autograder also relies on that same field name; otherwise your test will break if the staff solution renames or removes it.

Keep the reflection confined to test code only; production code should stay encapsulated.

Prefer public‑API assertions when possible; fall back to reflection only when the spec truly requires inspecting or mutating a private member.

Question
Also i may need to manually mock certain intefaces and classes. Should i override and add to the implementation or use the direct implementaation

Answer
Prefer a mocking framework (e.g., Mockito) if the assignment permits libraries—lets you stub or spy without writing extra classes.

If libraries are forbidden:

Interfaces: write a tiny test-only class (FakeWhatever implements SomeInterface) that overrides only the methods your test touches; keep the rest as default no-ops.

Abstract/base classes: create a minimal subclass inside the test sources and override required abstract methods.

Avoid changing production code just to make tests easier; keep fakes and stubs in the test source tree.

Use constructor or setter injection so the code under test receives either the real implementation or your fake.

Direct implementation is acceptable only when the real class is lightweight and has no external side effects (DB hits, threads, UI). Otherwise stub/mock to isolate behaviour.

Question
I can't use mockito which is why i plan to mock classes, but i just need general advice.

Answer
Inject dependencies so the class under test receives something you control (constructor, setter, or factory).

Interfaces: create a tiny test-only class implementing the interface; override only the methods your test calls, return fixed values, leave others empty.

Abstract / concrete classes: subclass in the test source, override the methods whose behaviour you must change; call super for the rest if they are side-effect-free.

Keep each fake < 20 LOC; one responsibility, predictable outputs, no sleep/threads/IO.

Pattern cheat-sheet:

Dummy – unused placeholder arg.

Stub – returns canned data.

Spy – records calls (called = true, args.add(x)), then assert later.

Use anonymous inner classes for one-off stubs:

java
Copy
Edit
new GameUI() {
    @Override public void draw() {/* no-op */}
};
If the real class is final / has final methods, wrap it in an interface or factory the production code already uses.

When you must mutate internals (e.g., private field state), prefer reflection in the test rather than altering the fake’s API.

Reset static/global state in @After to prevent leakage between tests.

Document each fake briefly so graders see it’s intentional, not missing production code.
